# fibonnaci-series
Explanation of the Fibonacci Series Code:
Imports:

import tkinter as tk: This imports the Tkinter library, which is used to create the GUI for the Fibonacci series application.
Function Definitions:

calculate_fibonacci(n):
This function generates the Fibonacci series up to n terms.
It handles different cases:
If n is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty list.
If n is 1, it returns a list containing only the first Fibonacci number, [0].
If n is 2, it returns the first two Fibonacci numbers, [0, 1].
For n greater than 2, it initializes a list with the first two Fibonacci numbers and iteratively calculates the next numbers by summing the last two numbers in the list until it reaches n terms.
Display Function:

display_fibonacci():
This function is called when the user clicks the button to generate the Fibonacci series.
It retrieves the number of terms from the input field, converts it to an integer, and calls calculate_fibonacci(num_terms).
The result is displayed in the result_label. If the input is invalid (not an integer), it shows an error message.
Creating the Main Window:

root = tk.Tk(): Initializes the main window for the application.
root.title("Fibonacci Series Generator"): Sets the title of the window.
Creating Widgets:

Input Field: An entry widget is created for the user to input the number of terms for the Fibonacci series.
Button: A button is created that, when clicked, calls the display_fibonacci() function to generate the series.
Result Label: A label is created to display the generated Fibonacci series or any error messages.
Starting the GUI Event Loop:

root.mainloop(): This starts the Tkinter event loop, allowing the GUI to respond to user interactions.
Conclusion:
The code is designed to create a simple GUI application that generates and displays the Fibonacci series based on user input. It is structured to handle various input scenarios and provides feedback to the user.
